# Weather-app

Ahhh API's. Man, this was a hard concept to understand. At the time, it made little to no sense to me how the internet and websites are able to house all of this data without manually typing things in. Then the veil was lifted. API's exist! 

This was my first time learning what an API was and how to implement one. In this project, I called to OpenWeatherMap's API to get weather data based on a user input zip code. This project definitely made me re-evaluate what was possible with coding and software.

Please take a look and let me know if you have any advice/questions!
